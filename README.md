# Browse By Command

Browse the internet via commands. No more moving your hand down to the mouse.

For example

g mdn filter
Search google for "mdn filter" and open the first result.
This lands us on the MDN filter docs page. Rather than typing mdn filter and then moving your hand to click the mouse.
